# ForecastingINDIAstockIndex
Historical index of NIFTY 50 was used to forecast NIFTY 50 using Holt Winterâ€™s Exponential Smoothing model and ARIMA model for shorter term forecasts. Other than that, a cointegration model was also built to take other macro factors into account to forecast NIFTY 50 for the long-term. Macro factors include both global growth and Indian internal indication.
